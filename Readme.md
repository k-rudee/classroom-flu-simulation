Overview
This project simulates the spread of the flu in an elementary school classroom of 61 kids, where one kid starts off infected. The simulation explores how the infection spreads over time, both without immunization and with a 50% chance of kids being immunized. The code is organized to address specific parts of the problem, including statistical analysis and visualization of results.

Contents
simulation_code.py: The main Python script containing all simulation code and analysis.
viz: A folder containing all generated visualizations from the simulation.
requirements.txt: A file listing all Python packages required to run the simulation.

Requirements
To run the simulation, you need Python installed on your system along with the following packages:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy


Quickstart

Create virutal env
python -m venv sim

Activate virtual env 
source sim/Scripts/activate

Install required packages 
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the simulation script
python simulation_code.py

This will execute the simulation and generate all analysis and visualizations.

View the outputs:

The script will print detailed statistical findings to the console.
Visualizations will be saved in the viz directory.

Description of the Simulation:

The simulation is divided into several parts, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the problem:

Part a: Calculates and visualizes the distribution of the number of kids Tommy infects on Day 1 using a Binomial distribution.
Part b: Computes the expected number of kids Tommy infects on Day 1.
Part c: Estimates the expected number of kids infected by Day 2, including Tommy.
Part d: Simulates the epidemic over time without immunization, providing expected new infections per day and epidemic durations.
Part e: Simulates the epidemic over time with a 50% chance of kids being immunized, comparing the results to the scenario without immunization.
Comparison and Results: A detailed comparison between the scenarios with and without immunization, including reductions in total infections and epidemic duration due to immunization.

Visualizations

All visualizations generated by the simulation are saved in the viz folder. The following plots are available:

day1_infection_distribution.png: Distribution of the number of kids Tommy infects on Day 1.
expected_infections_by_day.png: Expected number of new infections by day without immunization.
epidemic_durations.png: Histogram of epidemic durations without immunization.
expected_infections_by_day_immunization.png: Expected number of new infections by day with immunization.
epidemic_durations_immunization.png: Histogram of epidemic durations with immunization.
comparison_total_infections.png: Comparison of total infections with and without immunization.
comparison_epidemic_durations.png: Comparison of epidemic durations with and without immunization.
